This describes a positivity bias in the Vine review program.

### Other Recommendations:
1. Satistical distributions like mean, median and mode.
1. Plotting the boxplots helps to visualize the rating patterns between Vine vs Non-Vine.
1. Also doing the same analysis with 4-star rating might also help to determine the bais.
